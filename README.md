## üì£ News

- üéâ [2025.08] PatchAgent is presented at [USENIX Security 2025](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/yu-zheng)!

## üìã Overview

PatchAgent is an LLM-based program repair agent that mimics human expertise to automatically generate patches for real-world bugs. It integrates:

- **Language Server Protocol**: For accurate code navigation and analysis
- **Patch Verification**: For ensuring correct and safe fixes
- **Interaction Optimization**: To achieve human-like reasoning during vulnerability repair

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- Docker (for OSS-Fuzz integration)
- Git

### Installation

```bash
# Pull the image
docker pull ghcr.io/cla7aye15i4nd/patchagent:latest

# Run the container
docker run -it --privileged ghcr.io/cla7aye15i4nd/patchagent:latest
```

### Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file based on the template:

```bash
cp .env.template .env
# Edit .env with your API keys and configuration
```

## üíª Usage Example

PatchAgent can be used to repair real-world bugs. Here's a simple example:

```python
from patchagent.agent.generator import agent_generator
from patchagent.builder import OSSFuzzBuilder, OSSFuzzPoC
from patchagent.parser.sanitizer import Sanitizer
from patchagent.task import PatchTask

# Initialize the repair task
patchtask = PatchTask(
    [OSSFuzzPoC("poc.bin", "libpng_read_fuzzer")],  # Proof of Concept file with target
    OSSFuzzBuilder(
        "libpng",                        # Project name
        "/path/to/libpng",               # Source code path
        "/path/to/oss-fuzz",             # OSS-Fuzz path
        [Sanitizer.AddressSanitizer],    # Sanitizer to use
    ),
)

# Initialize and run the repair process
patchtask.initialize()
patch = patchtask.repair(agent_generator())
print(f"Generated patch: {patch}")
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

For development, we recommend using the VS Code devcontainer:

1. Install the [VS Code Remote Development Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack)
2. Open the repository in VS Code
3. When prompted, click "Reopen in Container"

This will set up a fully configured development environment with all the necessary tools.
